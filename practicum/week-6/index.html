        In practicum 5 you created a react application, imagequiz, and deployed it to
        <i>https://your-github-username.github.io/imagequiz/</i>.
        In this practicum you extend your imagequiz application to have the following functionality:
        <ol>
            <li>
                When users click on an image, they are navigated to a page (this page is a page in your application) that contains a quiz. The user then can take 
                the quiz. 
            </li>
            <li>Each quiz has six questions.</li>
            <li>Each question on the quiz has the following format: a picture and four options to choose from with only one of them
                being the correct answer. Each option contains a word supposed to be a name for the object in the picture.
                The user can only select one option in each question.
            </li>
            <li>At then end of the quiz the score of the user will be shown on the page. The user can reapet the same
                 quiz or can go to the home page to start another quiz.
            </li>
        </ol> 
        This practicum resembles the image quiz application of Cambridge Dictionary which is available at https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/plus/quiz/image/.
        Have a look at the Cambridge Dictionary image quiz application to gain a better understanding of the practicum requirements.
        <br />
        For this practicum, you only need to have <b>three quizzes</b>. So on 
        the homepage display at least three quizzes.
