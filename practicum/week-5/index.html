        In this practicum you write a simple web application in React.
        You need to create a new repository and name is <i>imagequiz</i>. 
        Do NOT use your ISTA330 repository for your development and 
        deployment of this practicum. You need to create a separate
        repository for this practicum. <br/> <br/>
        The web application should have the following pages:
        <ol>
            <li>A login page</li>
            <li>A home page</li>
        </ol>
        The folder 'images' contain several images.
        The homepage of the application should list
        all the images. For each image it should show the image and under the image
        it should show the name of the image.
        <br />
        Deploy your react application to github pages.
        If deployed successfully then your react application will be
        shown in the iframe below.
        <br />
        Follow the following naming convention when you 
        create your react application:
        <ol>
            <li>The name of your github repository for this application should be <i>imagequiz</i>.</li>
            <li> Below this line, you find an iframe element.
                The address that you provide for the iframe src attribute 
                should be <b> <i>https://your-github-username.github.io/imagequiz/</i> </b>
                where <i>your-github-username</i> is the username with which you
                created your github account.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="iframe-container">
