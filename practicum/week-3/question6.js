/*
A zero-indexed array A of length N 
contains all integers from 0 to N-1. 
Find and return the longest length of set S, 
where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } 
subjected to the rule below:

Suppose the first element in S starts with 
the selection of element A[i] of index = i, 
the next element in S should be A[A[i]], 
and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ Then you should stop 
adding elements to S just before a duplicate element 
occurs in S.

Example: 
input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
output:  4
     because the longest S is:
     S = {A[0], A[A[0]], A[A[A[0]]], A[A[A[A[0]]]]}
     A[0] = 5
     A[A[0]] = A[5] = 6
     A[A[A[0]]] = A[6] = 2
     A[A[A[A[0]]]] = A[2] = 0
     but A[A[A[A[A[0]]]]] = A[0] = 5 which is a duplicate.
